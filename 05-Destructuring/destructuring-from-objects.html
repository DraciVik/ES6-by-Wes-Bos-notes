const { twitter:tweet, facebook:fb } = wes.link.social // when we have nested data. Also the "twitter:tweet" is when we want to have the value in the twitter key and store in a variable called tweet.

const settings = {width: 300, color: "black"} // height, fontSize needed
const { width = 100, height = 100, color = "blue", fontSize = 25 } = settings; // assigning default.

// Object Destructuring with variable renaming & default values
const { w: width = 400, h: height = 500 } = { w: 800 }
// width and height are created. w and h are being destructured. w is destructured from w:800. h tries to be destructured from the right but it falls back to 500.
